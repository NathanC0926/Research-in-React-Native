- `src/components/ExampleComponent.js`: Example component.

## Notes

### Differences Between React and React Native

#### React (React.js):

- Uses standard HTML elements like `<div>`, `<span>`, `<h1>`, etc.
- Styling is done using CSS or CSS-in-JS libraries.
- Uses the virtual DOM for rendering.

#### React Native:

- Uses components that map to native UI elements, such as `<View>`, `<Text>`, `<ScrollView>`, etc.
- Styling is done using JavaScript objects, often with the `StyleSheet` API.
- Uses native APIs to render components, which means it doesnâ€™t use the virtual DOM.

### API Calls in React Native

- Use the `fetch` API or libraries like `Axios` to make API calls.

### Styling in React Native

- Use the `StyleSheet` API to define styles.
